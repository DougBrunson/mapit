## Neighborhood map:

To run: open index.html



### Note:
> A list-view of location names is provided which displays all locations by default, and displays the filter subset of locations when a filter is applied.
...
> There are at least 5 locations hard-coded in the model.

Since this app implements full search feature:
- There are no hard coded values (although you can click "I'm Feeling Luckly"), and they don't display by default (you have to search or feel lucky). I felt this was the best approach given my implementation.
- US locations only... international locations not yet supported
- Searches must be `terms in location`
